   Catched some outliers and intresting patterns in data there check it for more details
   
### 2)Feature Engineering
    
    Added new features here and removed some found outliers
    
### 3)Models

    Experimented with different models and did hyperparameter tuning for each model
    
### 4)LSTM_and_cnn

    created CNN with catogorical features and LSTM with numerical features
    
### 5)Stacking
